2011-05-09 - OpenPANA released
We are proud to present the first release of OpenPANA.

It's expected to be soon a full functional solution which implements the PANA protocol.
By now its a multithreading implementation which allows multiple users to authenticate 
using the hostapd EAP library.

Many aspects defined in IETF RFC 5191 and 5609 are covered such as
- Integrity check
- Authentication, authorization, reauthentication and termination phases are implemented.
- Sequence Number and Retransmission
- Pana SA
- Message Authentication
- Session Lifetime

Any comments and reports are welcomed in the OpenPANA mailing list available at 
openpana-users@lists.sourceforge.net
