Installation
============

These are installation instructions for Unix and Unix-like systems
that can run the "configure" script in this same directory. These
are not the installation instructions for Windows systems.

 1. OpenPANA requires the following libraries:

  - OpennSSL library
    http://wwww.openssl.org

  - Libxml2
    http://xmlsoft.org/

 2. Building the OpenPANA softwares:

  You can just run the './configure --sysconfdir=/etc/openpana' script and 'make'.
  If the --sysconfdir option is not added, configuration files will be placed under the '/usr/local/etc' directory.

 3. By running 'make install' as root OpenPANA will be installed tipically under '/usr/local/bin' and configuration files will be placed in '/etc/	openpana'.

* OpenPANA can be uninstalled by the 'make uninstall' command.

If you have trouble with the build or installation process, you can
find assistance on the openapana-users@list.sourceforge.net mailing list.
See http://openpana.sf.net for details.
